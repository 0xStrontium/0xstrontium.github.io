       <p> <a href="https://github.com/adnane-X-tebbaa/DownTime-Score">DownTime</a> is a Small project aimed to Monitor the performance and the availabillity of a variety of the Vital and Critical Moroccan Web Portals That provides necessary WebBased digital services in order to Record incidents including Services Outage,Network Disturbance and Possible CyberAttacks 
       in-powered with <a href="https://github.com/upptime/upptime">upptime/a> and  <a href="https://uptimerobot.com/">UpTime Robot/a>. (More to add soon)
	       
       <p> This Project is open source so the contributions are welcomed 
       <h4 id="">How it started  :</h4>
       one week ago i was trying to access the covid19 portal but each time i was trying to reach the website i was getting blocked for some reason the website shows an error i was sure that it was down  because few hours later i had access to it! So i had the idea ( since none of this Critical Websites that provides some of the necessary Digital Services have a status page) of Creating this Repo / Page and Make the Uptime Robot public Keys available More than that it is cool how upptime project works on github.
       <p>

	   <h4 id="">How it Works  :</h4>
	  upptime is an open source uptime Monitor / Status page SP this small project does not require a server because it's fully based and powered by Github, The User shedules a workflow to Run every "N" minutes (DownTime-Score N = 10min) so basically every "N" minutes uptime bot visites your Website to make sure it's up and Running
      the project provides so much more other configurations
