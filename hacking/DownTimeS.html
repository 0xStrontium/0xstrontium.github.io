       <p> DownTime-Score is a Small project aimed to Monitor the performance and the availabillity of a variety of the Vital and Critical Moroccan Web Portals That provides necessary WebBased digital services in order to Record incidents including Services Outage,Network Disturbance and Possible CyberAttacks 
       in-powered with upptime and uptime robot. (More to add soon)
	   <p> This Project is open source so the contributions are welcomed 
       <h4 id="">How it started  :</h4>
       one week ago i was trying to access the covid19 portal but each time i was trying to reach the website i was getting blocked for some reason the website shows an error i was sure that it was down  because few hours later i had access to it! So i had the idea ( since none of this Critical Websites that provides some of the necessary Digital Services have a status page) of Creating this Repo / Page and Make the Uptime Robot public Keys available More than that it is cool how upptime project works on github.
       <p>

	   <h4 id="">How it Works  :</h4>
	  upptime is an open source uptime Monitor / Status page SP this small project does not require a server because it's fully based and powered by Github, The User shedules a workflow to Run every "N" minutes (DownTime-Score N = 10min) so basically every "N" minutes uptime bot visites your Website to make sure it's up and Running
      the project provides so much more other configurations

	  <p> The Project currently Monitors 13 Web Portal those are the Most used in the country in case one of them is down the bot will automatically open an issue and falg it! as status down in red <a href="https://github.com/adnane-X-tebbaa/DownTime-Score/issues/11">(Example)</a> and the issue is considered as a past incident.
